## Technical Analysis: FPV Drone Components & Performance

### Component Impact on Flight Parameters

#### Propulsion System

- **Motors**: KV rating directly affects RPM per volt. Higher KV = more speed, lower KV = more torque
  - Formula: Max RPM = KV rating × Battery voltage
  - Example: 2400KV motor with 4S (16.8V) battery = 40,320 RPM
- **Propellers**: Size and pitch affect thrust, efficiency, and response time
  - Larger props = more thrust but slower response
  - Higher pitch = more speed but less efficiency
  - Thrust calculation: T = Ct × ρ × n² × D⁴ (where Ct is thrust coefficient, ρ is air density, n is rotational speed, D is prop diameter)

#### Power Distribution

- **Batteries**: Cell count (S rating) and capacity (mAh) balance flight time vs weight
  - Flight time estimation: t = (Battery capacity × 0.8 × 60) ÷ (Average amp draw × 1000) minutes
  - Weight impact: Every 100g added reduces flight time by approximately 10-15%
- **Power-to-Weight Ratio**: Critical for performance calculation
  - Minimum for stable flight: 2:1
  - Acrobatic performance: 7:1 or greater
  - Formula: PWR = Total thrust ÷ All-up weight

#### Frame & Materials

- **Carbon Fiber**: Most common material (3K, 4K, etc. indicates carbon fiber weave density)
  - 3mm thickness provides optimal strength-to-weight for most 5" builds
  - Tensile strength: ~3.5 GPa, Density: ~1.7 g/cm³
- **Aluminum**: Used for motor mounts and hardware
  - Good heat dissipation properties
  - Adds weight but improves motor cooling
- **TPU**: Used for 3D-printed components (camera mounts, antenna holders)
  - Shore hardness (95A typical) affects impact absorption

#### Flight Controller & Software

- **Gyro Update Rates**: Higher rates improve responsiveness
  - 8kHz gyro with 4kHz PID loop is standard for racing
- **Filtering**: Notch filters and dynamic filtering remove motor noise
  - Motor vibrations occur at frequencies = (RPM ÷ 60) × number of motor poles × propeller blades
- **PID Tuning Impact**:
  - P-gain: directly proportional to stick responsiveness
  - I-gain: affects how drone holds position against external forces
  - D-gain: dampens oscillations but increases motor temperature

### Advanced Calculations

#### Thrust-to-Weight Mapping

| TWR Value | Flight Characteristic            |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| <2:1      | Unable to hover efficiently      |
| 2:1 - 3:1 | Stable hover, minimal acro       |
| 3:1 - 5:1 | Good acro, medium agility        |
| 5:1 - 8:1 | Racing performance, high agility |
| >8:1      | Extremely aggressive maneuvers   |

#### Efficiency Calculations

- **Current Draw Estimation**: I = (Thrust × 3.5) ÷ Voltage
- **Motor Efficiency**: η = (Mechanical power out ÷ Electrical power in) × 100%
- **Optimal prop loading**: 2.5-3.5g/cm² for 5" freestyle builds
