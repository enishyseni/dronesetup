## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact on Flight Parameters

#### Motor & Propulsion System

- **KV Rating Impact**: Higher KV = more speed, lower KV = more torque

  ```
  Max RPM = KV rating √ó Battery voltage
  Example: 2400KV motor with 4S (16.8V) = 40,320 RPM
  ```

- **Propeller Calculations**: Thrust formula implementation
  ```
  T = Ct √ó œÅ √ó n¬≤ √ó D‚Å¥
  Where: Ct = thrust coefficient, œÅ = air density, n = RPM, D = diameter
  ```

#### Battery System Analysis

- **LiPo vs Li-Ion Characteristics**:

  - **LiPo**: Higher discharge rates (up to 100C), lighter weight
  - **Li-Ion**: Higher energy density, longer cycle life

- **Current Draw Estimation**:
  ```
  I = (Thrust √ó 3.5) √∑ Voltage
  Hover: 40-60% of max current
  Burst: 80-100% during maneuvers
  ```

#### Performance Classifications

- **Thrust-to-Weight Ratios**:
  - Acrobatic/Racing: >2.5:1
  - Sport/Freestyle: 2.0-2.5:1
  - Cinematic: 1.5-2.0:1
  - Long-range: 1.2-1.5:1

### Advanced Calculations

#### Motor Efficiency & Thermal Modeling

```
Efficiency (Œ∑) = (Mechanical Power Out √∑ Electrical Power In) √ó 100%
Temperature Rise = Power Loss √ó Thermal Resistance (¬∞C)
```

#### Fixed-Wing Specific Analysis

- **Wing Loading**: Weight √∑ Wing Area

  - Low loading (<30 oz/ft¬≤): Better slow-speed handling
  - High loading (>50 oz/ft¬≤): Higher speeds, wind penetration

- **Center of Gravity**:
  - Conventional: 25-35% of mean aerodynamic chord
  - Flying wings: 15-25% (more critical)
